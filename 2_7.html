        <h2 class="display-6">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="lead">The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades. From its humble beginnings to the current state of machine learning and deep learning, AI has come a long way.</p>
        
        <h2 class="display-6">Old AI</h2>
        <p class="fs-4">The old AI paradigm focused on rule-based systems and symbolic reasoning. This approach was based on the idea that intelligence could be replicated using a set of predefined rules and symbols.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>"The goal of AI is to create machines that can think and act like humans."</p>
            <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">John McCarthy, 1956</figcaption>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2 class="display-6">New Junctional AI</h2>
        <p class="fs-4">The new junctional AI paradigm focuses on machine learning and deep learning. This approach is based on the idea that intelligence can be learned from data and experience.</p>
        <p class="fst-italic">The new AI paradigm has led to significant advancements in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>
        
        <h2 class="display-6">Philosophical Implications</h2>
        <p class="fs-4">The development of AI raises several philosophical questions. For example, what is the nature of intelligence? Can machines truly think and act like humans?</p>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item">What is the relationship between human and machine intelligence?</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Can machines be creative and have free will?</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">What are the ethics of creating autonomous machines?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="display-6">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="fs-4">The philosophy of AI is a complex and multifaceted field. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the philosophical implications of creating intelligent machines.</p>
